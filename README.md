# 🦖 MOODJI: The Absurd Mood Translator

Welcome to **Moodji**, the world's most intentionally useless and whimsically chaotic AI translator. Built for those moments when human language fails and only a string of nonsensical emojis can truly express your soul.

## 🌟 What is Moodji?

Moodji takes your complex, nuanced human emotions and "translates" them into a completely random and absurd sequence of emojis. 

*   **Input:** "I'm feeling a bit tired but also excited for pizza."
*   **Moodji Output:** 🦖🍕🎩💃 (Wait, why is there a dinosaur in a top hat?)

It’s not accurate. It’s not helpful. But it is very funny.
